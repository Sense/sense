### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am not a robot ðŸ¤– but I like them. I love filling CAPTCHA as well, but I'm quite busy working hard on innovative stuff.
Here are some details about me:

- ðŸ§  I'm a Software Developer and I'm currently creating **Laravel Shopper** with some [teammates at ShopperLabs](https://github.com/shopperlabs) !
<!-- <> - ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently working on computer vision & cognitive science applied to artificial intelligence. -->
- ðŸ“š I'm happy to help anyone who struggles with code learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on indie products only.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to code or humans, I'm at ease with both.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I already `rm -rf /` my computer without no backup.
